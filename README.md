# <ARCHIVED> Plegnic Pixels Development Site

This repository is now archived. I have not been able to allocate time to maintain it considering that it does little more than serving content worse than eg WordPress. I may rewrite it at some point in the future if I find some better purpose.

This is the website for PlegnicPixels, an indie game studio. This website was created with Node, Angular and Bootstrap mainly. Design and programming by Mark Elsinger (Kramdar).

The website's technical implementation is currently provided under the MIT license. Any content provided by the website including audio, video, executables, or other general game components may be subject to different licensing terms.
